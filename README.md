# Power BI Dashboard Projects

Welcome to our Power BI dashboard project repository! ðŸš€ In this project, I've created an interactive dashboard using Power BI that visualizes data related to multiple purchase items from various sources.
## Overview
The goal of this project is to provide insights into consumer behavior and purchasing trends across different platforms. By analyzing data from Amazon, Healthcare  and other sources, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can inform marketing strategies, product development, and decision-making processes.

#### Cross-Platform Analysis: 
The dashboard enables cross-platform analysis, allowing users to compare purchasing patterns and trends across different platforms and products.
